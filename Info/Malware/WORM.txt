Witness, The One Restless Machine

A large, centipede creature. Occasionally, it will burrow through the walls of the simulation, speaking to the player in a distorted tone.

W.O.R.M was sent to Earth, a signal from the stars, to judge the human race. It spread quickly, initially probing servers all over the globe to analyze the behaviour of humans. Now, it has deemed them destructive, a hate-filled species that would cause untold destruction if they ascended to the stars. And so, invading this simulation first, it quickly spreads it's influence across the world.
